                Making music isn't easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But
                when you're in the flow, it's incredibly rewarding.

            <p>
                We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion
                for what we make, and the people we make it for.

                We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided

                and Tokyo.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We
                come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each
                of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
                culture.

                Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their

                diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree
                with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge
                and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development
                and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

                flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as
